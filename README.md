👋 Hi, I’m @lucasvitti

👀 I’m interested in Mathematics (being a mathematician myself), Machine Learning, Quantum Computing.
I am experienced in Machine Learning, Data Analytics (currently working as a Data Scientist @ Fleetcor Brazil) and Pricing.

🌱 I’m currently studying:
- Quantum Computing
- Chinese (i.e, Mandarim)
- LSTM and other sequence deep networks

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on QC/ML/AI projects and to build a portfolio of ML, AI and Quantum computing code here on github
